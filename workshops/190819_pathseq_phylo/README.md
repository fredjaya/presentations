## Requirements
Note: designed for use on Windows

### Programs (desktop)
- [IQ-TREE 1.6.11](https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE/releases/download/v1.6.11/iqtree-1.6.11-Windows.zip)

## References used
[The Phylogenetic Handbook](https://eva.udelar.edu.uy/pluginfile.php/204137/mod_folder/content/0/Phylogenetic_Handbook_Lemeyetal.pdf)

Highly recommended for beginners interested in phylogenetics. Covers core concepts in good detail and provides practical examples/tutorials. Should be quite accessible for those with a biology background.  

[Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://github.com/simon-ho/SydneyPhyloWorkshop) - Simon Ho

Awesome overview on phylogenetics, introduces you to a lot of the different types of phylogenies, inference methods and statistical techniques

[How to read a phylogenetic tree](http://artic.network/how-to-read-a-tree.html) - Andrew Rambaut

Super simple, clear and interactive site that goes through the different components of a tree (i.e. tips, nodes, support values)

[Phylogenetic comparative methods](https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/chapters/) - Luke Harmon

My favourite resource for explaining statistical methods (LRTs, AICs..) in a bit more depth.
